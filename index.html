      <p> In 2018 I helped Liberty Clark, Inc. achieve ISO 9001:2015 certification. The certification proved our commitment to 
      continuously improve our processes. This certification continues to attract customers in the medical device industry. We are one
      of few companies in our industry nationewide to acheive and maintain this certification. Our improved process documentation and managment
      has increased production rates which means we can offer shorter turnaround times.

      <p>During my time, I've been able to help Liberty Clark, Inc maintain a less than 1% fallout rate. This exceptional
      attention to our customer's product has secured trust from multiple Fortune 100 companies. Not only do we scrutinize our
      work but we've become a line-of-defense for manufacturerâ€™s internal quality. We've been able to save customer's time and 
      money by finding imperctions before we decorated their product.
      <ul>
        <li>Critical analysis of press operator's decorations</li>
        <li>Communicating with operators and verifying their understanding of the processes</li>

    <p>Consistency in this type of printing begins with graphic output and the development
      of the engraved plates and silk screens. My research and development has streamlined the process and made it
      easily replicable for our team. My understanding of Adobe software programs has allowed Liberty Clark to offer 
      artwork creation and improvement for customer's without those capabilities. I've also implemented more thorough
      artwork proofs. The high standards of our medical customers means we have to clearly visualize and communicate our 
      end goal.
      <ul>
        <li>Designing artwork proofs and diagrams for customer approval</li>
        <li>Creating digital mock-ups to help customers visualize the end-product </li>

        <li>Developing/engraving the photosensitive plates </li>
